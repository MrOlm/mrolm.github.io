I am a PhD Candidate in [Jill Banfield's lab](http://nanogeoscience.berkeley.edu/) at The University of California, Berkeley. I use metagenomics to study the human microbiome, the hospital microbiome, and how the two interact. Along the course of my research I have developed several open-source programs and bioinformatics tools for analysis of genome-resolved metagenomic data.
