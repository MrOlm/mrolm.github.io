I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Justin Sonnenburg's lab](https://sonnenburglab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I received by PhD in [Jill Banfield's lab](http://nanogeoscience.berkeley.edu/) at The University of California, Berkeley in 2019. I study the human microbiome and microbial population genetics, and have developed several open-source programs and bioinformatics tools for analysis of genome-resolved metagenomic data.
