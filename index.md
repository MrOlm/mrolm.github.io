I am a postdoctoral research fellow in [Justin Sonnenburg's lab](https://sonnenburglab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, where I conduct detailed, strain-resolved research on the human microbiome. I have developed several open-source programs and bioinformatics tools. I received my PhD in [Jill Banfield's lab](http://nanogeoscience.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley in 2019.

In Fall 2024 I will be starting as an [Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder's Department of Integrative Physiology](https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/people/faculty/matthew-r-olm). Please see my [research laboratory page](https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/research/integrative-microbiome-research-laboratory) for opportunities for graduate students, undergraduates, and postdoctoral fellows.
